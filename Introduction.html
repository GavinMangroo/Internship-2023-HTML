                Greetings! My name is Gavin Mangroo and I am currently a Computer Science (CS) Major at the University of Guyana.<br> <br>I was born and raised in Guyana my entire life. Mae's Schools is where all of my early academic life was spent, graduating in the year 2017 from high school. After graduating is when I found my passion for technology and with that passion I attended Global Technology for about one (1) year, learning the foundations of a few programming languages including: C, Python, Java and SQL. After, I decided to take my studies to the tertiary level and attended the University of Guyana (UG) with Computer Science as my primary major in the year 2021. I am expecting to graduate with my Bachelors degree in 2025.

            </h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Problem solving is a huge factor of who I am. Because of this I tend to look at a lot of mystery centered shows and also play a lot of strategy games. As of writing up this introduction, I have recently taken an interest in Chess and practice whenever I have the free time. This also explains my passion for programming. There is always that moment of eureka whenever a problem is solved this way.<br>
          
                <br>When it comes to hobbies, I mostly spend my free time expanding my knowledge of Astronomy, reading the Type-Moon Wiki, gaming with friends or building small random applications with code. Astronomy has always sparked my interest as it is fascinating to think about the many celestial entities, their behaviours and the immensity of space. Chess had piqued my interest reently due to the element of strategy required to play. These elements shape who I am today; a <strong>space fanatic and strategy enthusiast</strong>.

                Goals
            </h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                My goals are as <em>simple</em> as they come. As a Compuer Science (CS) student, I hope to one day make a contribution to the world through technological advancement. The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically, grabbed my interest with recent innovations such as natural language generation, machine learning and robotic process automation. So, I would like to develop my knowledge base to a level where I am capable of working on such complex and exciting projects in the fututre. Many people believe Artificial Intelligence (AI) may lead to a dystopian future, however I think they can be a great asset to humans if applied correctly.
